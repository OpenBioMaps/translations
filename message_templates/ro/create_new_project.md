\[%PROJECT_TABLE%\] new database: %table%

## Stimate %username%!

You have created a new database \[%table%\] on the %DOMAIN% server.

You can find it here: [%table%](http://milvus.openbiomaps.org/projects/teszt/%PROTOCOL%%port%://%OB_DOMAIN%/projects/%table%/index.php)

Use this email address and your password to sign in.

After you logged in your database, you should set some or several things depending on your demands:

1. Assign your database columns to OBM
2. Set your map files
3. Set your trigger functions
4. Set your SQL queries
5. Set your map layers
6. Enable modules you need
7. Set up upload forms
8. Set up user groups
9. Set up local language files

Please note, some of these settings can be complicated at the first time.

Read the manuals, ask on the forum, ask %PROJECT_TABLE%'s administrator or ask the OBM Team.
